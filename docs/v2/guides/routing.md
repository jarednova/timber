Timber 1.x allowed for custom routes. However, in 2.x and above this should be handled by a third-party plugin or library like:

- [Upstatement/routes](https://github.com/Upstatement/routes)
- [Rareloop/router](https://github.com/Rareloop/router)
- [Brain-WP/Cortex](https://github.com/Brain-WP/Cortex)
